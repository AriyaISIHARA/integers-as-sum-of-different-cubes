this is cubism

## overview
can any integer be represented as the sum of different cubes?
the code searches such representation for several small numbers.

## files
- a.py : main program

## usage
```
% python a.py
```

## python
developped and tested on 3.8
hopefully runs on 3.6 or later.

## installation
- open 'a.py' by any viewer
- type it on any editor

## result
```
1: (1,)
2: (-5, -6, 7)
3: (1, -5, -6, 7)
4: (-1, -2, 3, 4, -5, 6, 7, -8)
```
and then my PC got down.
give me some more money.
